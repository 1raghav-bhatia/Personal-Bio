Used the company’s balance sheet and cash flow statement to project future cash flow required to pay back the debt incurred from the leverage buyout and thereby project a return schedule for an exit in the future.\n• Compiled Merger and Acquisition data for FMCG companies in the Middle East and Africa to extrapolate revenue and profitability multiples in the sector.\n\n\n\n\n\n• Constructed Dynamic Hedging Portfolios to replicate European Option payoffs using a Delta-Gamma hedging framework.\n• Analyzed Mortgage Payment Data to simulate the payoffs of Principle Only and Interest Only Mortgage-Backed Securities.\n\n\n• Utilized a stable equilibrium model which captured the relationship between creative destruction and aggregate real growth. Focused on the reallocation of investments across firms as the main factor behind the creative destruction process.\n• Used the model setup to evaluate various fiscal policy measures aimed at reallocating investment capital across firms.
